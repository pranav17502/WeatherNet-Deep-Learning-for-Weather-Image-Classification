# WeatherNet: Deep Learning for Weather Image Classification

I had taken a bootcamp on deep learning. This was the final project which was to be submitted for completion of the bootcamp during the summers of 2021. 

The data-set is also available in the repository. 


## Features

- Processed the image dataset and classified it into 5 types with the help of Convolutional Neural Networks
- Developed a weather image classification system using Neural Networks, achieving 83% accuracy
- Conducted comparative analysis of CNN models (VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101) for optimal performance
- Utilized OpenCV library for image processing and performed exploratory data analysis to gain valuable insights




## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pranav17502/WeatherNet-Deep-Learning-for-Weather-Image-Classification/
```
